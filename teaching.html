				<h3> Pedagogical Research and Learning Science</h3>
				<p>
					I am interested in understanding the science behind learning and teaching. <!--I strive to improve my teaching and mentoring while working with students.  both as an instructor and while mentoring students. -->
					<!--how we can design teaching to be effective for student learning. pedagogigal research, learning science and in understanding how we learn. -->
					I nurture this interest through my role as a  
					<!--with the Eberly Center From Jan 2015 (with a break in 2017), I have been fortunate to be in a really interesting role of a -->
					<b>Graduate Teaching Fellow (GTF)</b> with the <b>Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation</b>. In some universities, this role is known as graduate teaching peer consultant. The GTF program has two main goals. First, we support the professional
					development of the CMU graduate student community in their teaching.
					Our responsibilities include providing classroom observations,
					facilitating microteaching workshops, providing feedback on teaching
					strategies, and facilitating early-course feedback focus groups in
					classroom. Second, we ourselves gain deeper professional development in pedagogy 
					through consultation training, as well as pedagogical reading and
					discussions. Our regular GTF meetings are led by <a href="http://www.eberly.cmu.edu/people/eedaniel">Dr. Emily Weiss</a> and <a href="http://www.eberly.cmu.edu/people/eedaniel">Dr. Jessica Harrell</a>. More details about the center can be found at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/EberlyCenterAnnualReport-AY201415.pdf"> the Annual report for 2014-15</a> and on their <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/">website</a>. The most interesting part of this role is that I get to work with students in various departments at CMU - philosophy, language, history, design, other areas in engineering, and am learning about diverse approaches to learning and teaching.
