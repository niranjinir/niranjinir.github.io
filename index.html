			<!--I am a Research Scientist at Amazon. I am working on a new technology initiative within the Amazon Devices organization. My research interests are in wireless embedded sensing systems. I enjoy experimental research. I like working on the messy problems we encounter while deploying real-world sensing systems at scale. <br><br>-->

			I am a Senior Research Scientist in Amazon. I am working on emerging energy technologies in the Devices org. This website mostly has details of my work up to 2019 (pre-Amazon days).<br><br>

			<b><span style="color:#99004d;">About:</span></b><br>
			I have 15+ years of experience in networked embedded sensing systems research and engineering. I enjoy experimenting with sensing systems and designing sensor data processing algorithms. I have worked with various sensing modalities including electric and magnetic field, current and voltage, visible light, inertial, ultrasonic, and wireless sensing. I have an aptitude to work across different layers of the distributed sensing system stack, with focus close to the physical layer. 

			<!--My PhD was in indoor localization. I deployed and evaluated all my indoor localization solutions in the real-world. My work won the Microsoft International Indoor Localization Competition twice, with two different sensing systems.

			I research and build networked embedded sensing technologies. I am excited about the power of distributed sensing systems to bring us meaningful and actionable insights. I enjoy experimental research, designing sensor data processing algorithms and solutions, and solving the messy problems we encounter while deploying these solutions at scale in real-world environments.<br><br>

			I have an aptitude to work across different layers of the distributed sensing system stack, with focus close to the physical layer. My experience has spanned the areas of time-synchronization, visible light communication, application design with UWB, WiFi, BLE and ultrasonic ranging systems; time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival localization; sensor fusion of inertial, magnetic field and time-of-flight sensors; designing algorithms and tools for deploying localization systems; leading a team to execute data collection in the field; creating a road map for employing simulation in a new sensing domain; applying signal processing and machine learning algorithms for novel sensing applications. --><br><br>

			<b><span style="color:#99004d;">Background:</span></b><br>

			I got my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University</a> in July 2019. I was advised by <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/"> Prof. Anthony Rowe</a> and <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~brunos/">Prof. Bruno Sinopoli</a>. I defended this: <i>Localization, Beacon Placement and Mapping for Range-Based Indoor Localization Systems</i> [<a href="./Niranjini_files/Niranjini_PhDthesis.pdf">PDF</a>; <a href="./Niranjini_files/NiranjiniRajagopal_defense_talk_vl.pdf">Defense slides</a>]. My thesis is heavily experimental. I deployed and evaluated all methods I present in my thesis in real-world settings. My work in indoor localization won the International Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition twice, in 2015 with an ultrasonic localization system and in 2018 with an UWB localization system.<br><br><!--  defended my thesis <i>Localization, Beacon Placement and Mapping for Range-Based Indoor Localization Systems</i> <a href="./Niranjini_files/Niranjini_PhDthesis.pdf">(PDF)</a> in July 2019. -->

			During my PhD, I was affiliated with <a href="http://wise.ece.cmu.edu">WiseLab</a> and <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/index.html">CyLab</a>. I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://www.terraswarm.org">Terraswarm Research Center</a> from 2013-2017, the NIST PSCR (Public Safety Communications Research) project for  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/infrastructure-free-localization-system-firefighters">firefighter localization</a> since 2017 and the <a href="https://conix.io">CONIX Research Center</a> from 2018. I interned at Texas Instruments and Apple during my PhD.<br><br>

			I received the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/leadership/pres-fellow-scholar/">Carnegie Mellon University William S. Dietrich II Presidential Ph.D. Fellowship</a> in 2015 and the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/labs/fellowship/index.html">Samsung PhD Fellowship</a> in 2016 . <br><br>

			Prior to my PhD, I received an MS degree from CMU in 2012 and a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India </a> in 2008. Between my B.Tech and MS degree, I worked as an IC Design Engineer at Analog Devices and an R&D engineer at Signals and Systems in India. <br><br>

			<!--I enjoy traveling, being outdoors, and trying out new cuisines. 
			I've had interesting experiences in France, Germany, Honduras (got my PADI scuba diving certification here!), India, Italy, Japan, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal (learnt surfing for a week!), Turkey, and the US over the past many years. --><br><br>
