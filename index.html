			I am a Research Scientist at Amazon. I am working on a new technology initiative within the Amazon Devices organization. My research interests are in wireless embedded sensing systems. I enjoy experimental research. I like working on the messy problems we encounter while deploying real-world sensing systems at scale. <br><br>

			I got my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University</a> in July 2019. I was advised by <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/"> Prof. Anthony Rowe</a> and <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~brunos/">Prof. Bruno Sinopoli</a>. I defended this: <i>Localization, Beacon Placement and Mapping for Range-Based Indoor Localization Systems</i> <a href="./Niranjini_files/Niranjini_PhDthesis.pdf">(PDF)</a>. My thesis is heavily experimental. I deployed and evaluated all methods I present in my thesis in real-world settings. My work in indoor localization won the International Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition, twice.<br><br><!--  defended my thesis <i>Localization, Beacon Placement and Mapping for Range-Based Indoor Localization Systems</i> <a href="./Niranjini_files/Niranjini_PhDthesis.pdf">(PDF)</a> in July 2019. -->

			During my PhD, I was affiliated with <a href="http://wise.ece.cmu.edu">WiseLab</a> and <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/index.html">CyLab</a>. I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://www.terraswarm.org">Terraswarm Research Center</a> from 2013-2017, the NIST PSCR (Public Safety Communications Research) project for  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/infrastructure-free-localization-system-firefighters">firefighter localization</a> since 2017 and the <a href="https://conix.io">CONIX Research Center</a> from 2018. I interned at Texas Instruments and Apple during my PhD.<br><br>

			I received the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/leadership/pres-fellow-scholar/">Carnegie Mellon University William S. Dietrich II Presidential Ph.D. Fellowship</a> in 2015 and the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/labs/fellowship/index.html">Samsung PhD Fellowship</a> in 2016 . <br><br>

			Prior to my PhD, I received an MS degree from CMU in 2012 and a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India </a> in 2008. Between my B.Tech and MS degree, I worked as an IC Design Engineer at Analog Devices and an R&D engineer at Signals and Systems in India. <br><br>

			I enjoy traveling, being outdoors, and trying out new cuisines. 
			I've had interesting experiences in France, Germany, Honduras (got my PADI scuba diving certification here!), India, Italy, Japan, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal (learnt surfing for a week!), Turkey, and the US over the past many years. <br><br>
